# Sprint 3 Roadmap

## The sprint 3 roadmap has been designed in order to allow this group to have a good understanding of the upcoming plan for the work.

This sprint will start off with the Scrum master and product owner allocation. (This will be documented seperately)
The beginning of this coursework is to design a static background in html based on the wireframe we produced in sprint 3. This documentation is very important as it allows team members to have a central point that they can work towards.
This work will only include the static parts of the pages and will not involve any buttons or interactive features until it follows the rough design. Alterations to this design will be made in the Sprint 4 work, we currently only require a
basic visual aspect.
During this time, the database will be created as well as development for integration of the database so that as the dynamic parts of the HTML pages are created, the SQL commands are ready to be committed.
Rough dynamic features will be created, as a tech demo during our sprint review to show that we can use a feature and are able to get it to follow CRUD. The features will follow page design, and should any of the pages not have the capacity to follow
any features in the dynamic buttons, it will be added to a seperate page that will just be used as a showcase of functionality rather than anything that is aesthetically pleasing.
Once the features have been implemented, Travis CI will be used for testing and will be used to help review the functionality of the code.

Other miscellaneous tasks that need to be done are:
-Create Documentation that will help the team understand the coursework
-Alter suggested documentation from the Sprint 2 coursework review
-Review wireframe and make some final changes before implementation
